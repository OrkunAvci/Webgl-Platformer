Open up `index.html` in your favorite browser to run hte project.

If you have problems with loading up the textures from local storage(due to security restrictions), serve assets on a HTML server. You can easily do so via running any of these commands on terminal:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer
python -m SimpleHTTPServer <port_number>
python3 -m http.server
```
